"# My notes" 

To build the chess board, make a multidimensional matrix

Board is position - 1

board[][] = new ChessPiece(ChessGame.TeamColor.(Color),ChessPiece.PieceType.(Piece Type))

for ChessPosition, set new variables called saveRow and saveCol

Do same thing for ChessMove. Remember that promotion is different from the other two.
